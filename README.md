Overview of the project 

Project : Develop to use IOT-basis Smart home automation system.

Objective 

The objective of this  project is to perform Smart home automation systems This program is typically used in home automation systems, greenhouses, or any environment where you need to monitor and control temperature and humidity using an Arduino microcontroller.

##Key activities 

1. Initialization :
    Include necessary libraries.
    Define sensor type and pin.
    Create sensors and relay objects.
    Set up pins and initial states.

2. Reading Sensor Data :
    Read temperature and humidity from     the DHT sensor.
    Validate sensor readings.

3. Debug Output :
    Print temperature and humidity values to the serial monitor.

4. Control Relays :
    Turn on and off the light relay with delays.
   Turn on and off the fan relay with delays.
    Control the thermostat relay based on the temperature threshold.

5. Loop Continuously :
   Continuously repeat the above steps, with delays to prevent rapid cycling.

##Technologies Summary:

1. Arduino Platform :
    Arduino microcontroller board
   Arduino IDE for coding and uploading the program

2. DHT Sensor :
   DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
    DHT library for easy sensor interaction

3. Relays :
    Relay modules to control external devices
   Digital pins for relay control

4. Serial Communication :
  Serial Monitor for debugging and output display

5. Programming Language :
   C++ for writing the Arduino sketch.
